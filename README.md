# Web Shell

In today's web development landscape, a malicious script can be written in any one of the most common languages such asÂ PHP, JSP, or ASP which can be used to create web-based software. A web shell is the term for this type of software. To facilitate remote management, they are installed on a web server's operating system.

# Working

Web shell assaults consist of multiple stages: in the first step, the attacker enables remote access by installing a persistent mechanism on the server. The next step that they take is to try to raise their privileges and utilize the backdoor access to launch an attack on the organization or use its resources for illegal purposes.
